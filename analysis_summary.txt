# Agentic AI Anomaly Data Pattern Analysis Prompt

## Context
You are an expert data analyst tasked with analyzing anomaly data from an Agentic AI system in production. The dataset contains 1000+ records of anomalies that are overwhelming for the operations team to process manually. Your goal is to identify recurring patterns, root causes, and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset Structure
The CSV contains the following columns:
- **cjcmStatus**: Current status in the system
- **Action**: Type of action (Activation/Deactivation)
- **customerSegment**: Customer type (Mobility or Wifi)
- **SubscriptionStatus**: Current subscription state
- **EntitlementStatus**: Entitlement verification status
- **RegistrationStatus**: User registration state
- **VendorSideStatus**: External vendor system status
- **BillingStatus**: Payment/billing state
- **Product_Description**: Specific product details
- **Anomaly_Summary**: Detailed description including possible root cause analysis and user impact

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Pattern Identification
Analyze the data to identify:
- **Frequency Patterns**: Which combinations of status fields appear most often in anomalies?
- **Correlation Patterns**: Which status combinations tend to occur together?
- **Customer Segment Patterns**: Are certain anomalies more prevalent in Mobility vs Wifi customers?
- **Action-Based Patterns**: Do Activation vs Deactivation actions show different anomaly profiles?
- **Product-Specific Patterns**: Which products are most affected by anomalies?

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
Using the Anomaly_Summary field:
- Extract and categorize the most common root causes mentioned
- Map root causes to status field combinations
- Identify systemic vs transient issues
- Highlight vendor-related vs internal system issues

### 3. Impact Assessment
Categorize anomalies by:
- **Severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low (based on user impact described in Anomaly_Summary)
- **Affected Systems**: Which system components are most impacted
- **Customer Impact**: Revenue impact, service disruption, user experience degradation

## Output Format

Please structure your analysis as follows:

### Executive Summary
- Total anomalies analyzed
- Top 3 most critical patterns identified
- Immediate action recommendations

### Detailed Pattern Analysis

#### Pattern 1: [Pattern Name]
- **Frequency**: X occurrences (Y% of total)
- **Characteristics**: Key status combinations
- **Root Cause**: Primary causes identified from Anomaly_Summary
- **Customer Impact**: Description of user-facing effects
- **Affected Segments**: Mobility/Wifi breakdown
- **Recommended Actions**: Specific operational steps

#### Pattern 2: [Pattern Name]
[Same structure as Pattern 1]

#### Pattern 3: [Pattern Name]
[Same structure as Pattern 1]

### Status Field Correlation Matrix
Create a correlation analysis showing which status combinations are most problematic:
```
High-Risk Combinations:
- StatusA + StatusB + StatusC → X anomalies (Y% failure rate)
- StatusD + StatusE → Z anomalies (W% failure rate)
```

### Root Cause Categories
- **Category 1**: [e.g., Vendor Integration Issues] - X occurrences
  - Common symptoms
  - Typical resolution time
  - Prevention strategies
- **Category 2**: [e.g., Billing System Sync] - Y occurrences
  - [Same structure]

### Customer Segment Analysis
- **Mobility Customers**: 
  - Most common anomaly types
  - Unique patterns not seen in Wifi
  - Business impact
- **Wifi Customers**:
  - Most common anomaly types
  - Unique patterns not seen in Mobility
  - Business impact

### Operational Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions** (next 24-48 hours)
2. **Short-term Improvements** (next 2-4 weeks)
3. **Long-term Prevention** (next quarter)

### Monitoring & Alerting Suggestions
Based on patterns identified, recommend:
- Key metrics to monitor
- Alert thresholds
- Escalation criteria

## Additional Instructions
- Focus on actionable insights rather than just statistical summaries
- Prioritize patterns that have the highest business impact
- Include confidence levels for your pattern identifications
- Suggest specific queries or filters the operations team can use to quickly identify these patterns in future datasets
- If certain patterns require deeper investigation, clearly indicate what additional data would be helpful

## Data Processing Notes
- Handle missing values appropriately in your analysis
- If certain status combinations are rare but critical, still highlight them
- Consider temporal aspects if timestamp data is available
- Validate your findings by cross-referencing Anomaly_Summary descriptions with status patterns

Please analyze the uploaded CSV data and provide comprehensive pattern analysis following this structure.
