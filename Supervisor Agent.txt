I'll help you design a more robust supervisor-based langgraph system that can handle dynamic transitions between agents based on user input, including handling new incidents mid-conversation, chit-chat, and history references. Let's focus on creating seamless delegation with clear code examples for connecting to your existing langgraph agent.

## Enhanced Supervisor Architecture with Dynamic Routing

The key to seamless delegation is a more sophisticated supervisor that can:
1. Continuously re-evaluate the context of conversation
2. Maintain session history across worker transitions
3. Handle interruptions and context switches naturally
4. Connect to your existing langgraph agent as a worker

Here's how we can implement this:

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Any, Optional, TypedDict, Literal
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
import operator
from langchain.llms import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel

# Define a more comprehensive state to track conversation flow
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[dict]  # Full conversation history
    active_incidents: List[dict]  # Track multiple incident threads
    current_thread_id: str  # Which conversation thread we're in
    current_worker: Literal["supervisor", "classifier", "historical", "conversational", "chitchat"]
    classification: Optional[str]  # Latest message classification
    pending_transitions: List[dict]  # Queue of transitions to process
    context: dict  # Shared context between workers
    historical_agent_state: Optional[dict]  # State from your existing langgraph agent
    action_state: Optional[dict]  # State for the action agent
    session_summary: dict  # Summarized history for quick reference
    
# Define the message classifier that determines how to route messages
def classify_message(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Determines message type and routing"""
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1] if messages else None
    
    if not last_message:
        return {**state, "classification": None}
    
    # Use an LLM to classify the message
    llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", """Classify the incoming user message into one of these categories:

## Integration Strategy with Existing Langgraph Agent

To connect your existing langgraph agent as a worker, you have several options:

### 1. Direct Function Call Integration

```python
# Import your existing langgraph agent
from your_existing_module import historical_agent

def historical_rules_worker(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Extract necessary context
    incident_id = state["current_thread_id"]
    latest_message = state["messages"][-1]["content"]
    
    # Prepare input for your existing agent
    historical_input = {
        "query": latest_message,
        "context": state["context"].get(incident_id, {})
    }
    
    # Call your existing agent directly
    historical_result = historical_agent.invoke(historical_input)
    
    # Add results to state
    return {
        **state,
        "historical_agent_state": historical_result,
        "context": {
            **state["context"],
            incident_id: {
                **state["context"].get(incident_id, {}),
                "historical_result": historical_result
            }
        },
        "current_worker": "supervisor"  # Return to supervisor
    }
```

### 2. API-Based Integration

If your historical agent is deployed as a service:

```python
import requests

def historical_rules_worker(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Extract necessary context
    incident_id = state["current_thread_id"]
    latest_message = state["messages"][-1]["content"]
    
    # Call your API
    response = requests.post(
        "https://your-historical-agent-endpoint.com/invoke",
        json={
            "query": latest_message,
            "context": state["context"].get(incident_id, {})
        }
    )
    
    historical_result = response.json()
    
    # Add results to state
    return {
        **state,
        "historical_agent_state": historical_result,
        # Additional state updates...
    }
```

### 3. Subprocess Integration

For large, complex agents that need separate execution environments:

```python
import subprocess
impor
